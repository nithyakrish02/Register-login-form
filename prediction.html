            <p style="text-align: left;">Now a dayâ€™s people are suffering from skin diseases, More than 125 million people suffering
               from Psoriasis also skin cancer rate is rapidly increasing over the last few decades 
               especially Melanoma is most diversifying skin cancer. If skin diseases are not treated at an
                earlier stage, then it may lead to complications in the body including spreading of the 
                infection from one individual to the other. The skin diseases can be prevented by 
                investigating the infected region at an early stage. The characteristic of the skin images
                 is diversified so that it is a challenging job to devise an efficient and robust algorithm 
                 for automatic detection of skin disease and its severity. Skin tone and skin colour play
                 an important role in skin disease detection. Colour and coarseness of skin are visually 
                 different. Automatic processing of such images for skin analysis requires quantitative 
                 discriminator to differentiate the diseases.<p>
